# Employee-Management-System
Employee management system is a simple console application developed using
C language. Our mini project utilizes various aspects of C language such as file
handling, linked lists, arrays and data structures. With this simple application,
users can perform all the basic job related operations and features provided by
today's employee management system. It also provides an easy way for users
to select a command from command menu to perform the above and to input
data from the keyboard. We have also a implemented a system which makes
the task easier for searching for a particular employee's details such as name,
age, salary, department and other details.
